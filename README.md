# SQL-Challenge

Description:

This project contains three parts, Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

The first part is seen in the Entity Relationship Diagram titled "ERD_Data_Modeling" within the EmployeeSQL folder.

The second part is seen in the "Data_Engineering" sql file. Six table schemas were created with established relationships bewteen primary and foreign keys. These schemas were created to have data stored in third normal form to allow for improved query performance and reduced data redundancy.

Lastly, the analysis contains queries built to retrieve specific data across the database. The queries include joins, subqueries, and a combination of both.
