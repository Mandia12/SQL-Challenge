# SQL-Challenge

## Overview

This project focuses on designing, building, and analyzing a relational database for employee data. It is divided into three main parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

## Dataset
The project leverages an employee dataset with various attributes related to employee records. The data is structured into multiple tables to ensure efficient storage and retrieval.

## Steps
1. Data Modeling:
* An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to visualize the database structure, outlining the relationships between different tables.
* The ERD can be found in the file titled "ERD_Data_Modeling" within the EmployeeSQL folder.

2. Data Engineering:
* Six table schemas were designed and implemented to store the employee data in third normal form (3NF), ensuring reduced data redundancy and improved query performance.
* Relationships between tables were established using primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
* The SQL scripts for creating the schemas and relationships are located in the "Data_Engineering" SQL file.
  
3. Data Analysis:
* Various SQL queries were developed to extract meaningful insights from the database.
* These queries involve complex operations such as joins and subqueries, allowing for comprehensive data analysis across the database.
* The analysis showcases the use of advanced SQL techniques to retrieve specific data points relevant to employee management.
  
## Tools
* SQL for database design, table creation, and data querying.
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for data modeling and visualization.
  
## Results
The project delivers a fully normalized relational database with optimized table schemas and a set of powerful SQL queries that enable detailed analysis of employee data. The use of third normal form (3NF) enhances query performance and ensures efficient data storage.
